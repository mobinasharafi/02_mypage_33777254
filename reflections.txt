In this text file I aim to provide all that I have learnt in these labs shortly:

Lab 1: this lab taught me the fundemental logic behind building a web server using node.js and
helped with understanding the logic behind it, I learnt to take use of the Visual Studio as a complete
workspace, we created a basic server and layed the foundational grounding for the work needed in the 
following labs.

Lab 2: this lab taught me how to take record of my coding progress and how to represent it to my professor
and gave me clarity on how my workflow will be monitized. I learnt how to stage, commit and push changes to GitHub
I faced issues with my website which made me make a mistake of changing my port to 5000, and then 3000, but the issue
I was facing and the solution I found only worsened my process later by preventing the gold server to go through since 
it only responds on port 8000, the mistake which has been recorded in my GitHub. I did experimentation with the design of 
my website and made this process feel less like an administrative task.

Lab 3: this lab contained connecting to a virtual machine via SSH, using Git pulls and Running the app indefinitely with 
forever command, it made me aware of the technical difficulty of making a mistake in the earlier processes of coding, and overall
functioned as an extension to my understanding and persistence with getting my work done right.
